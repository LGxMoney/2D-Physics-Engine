# 2D-Physics-Engine
A simple physics engine to simulate a ball bouncing around in an applet.

This project was made to play around with JFrame, Threads, and Objects. It served it's purpose as an educational tool for playing with numerous ideas and combining multiple aspects of software. 

Ball: This class is meant to determine the specific physics of any balls generated. It also holds methods for controlling the ball with arrow keys. With the left and right keys you can move laterally and with space you can initiate a small jump. It's kind of fun to mess with!

Platform: This class is meant to determine a simple platform that our ball can interact with. It served it's purpose when it came to attempting to determine collisions with the ball.

Starting Point: This class serves as our main driver class, initiating and setting up the other classes and objects to work together.
